Perseus is a free collection of useful Autodesk® Maya® plug-ins. 
After installing Perseus Tools, an additional pull-down menu will be added to the end of the main Maya menu providing easy access to a variety of tools and utilities for daily use.

prSquash -> https://perseusrigging.com/prsquash/ 
The “prSquash” is a powerful deformer node developed for Autodesk Maya  that combines twist, squash, stretch, and bend deformations. It simplifies the process of creating bendy squash and stretch effects, especially for cartoony head models or chewing animations.  

prVectorConstraint -> https://perseusrigging.com/prvectorConstraint/
prVectorConstraint is a powerful tool developed for Maya that simplifies the process of creating complex custom rigs such as skirts, collars, or sleeves. Traditionally, rigging such components involved using various techniques like IK solvers, RBF solvers, angle calculations, normalization, and mesh-related operations like ray casting or closestPointOnMesh. While these methods have their merits depending on the project requirements, they often involve creating multiple nodes and can be time-consuming. The prVectorConstraint plugin aims to streamline this process by providing a single node that simplifies the rigging workflow.

prPairBlend -> https://perseusrigging.com/prpairblend/
The prPairBlend plugin is a tool that is developed for Maya and designed to address the challenges of using rotation values as drivers for blendshape targets or set-driven keys in Maya. Unlike translation parameters, rotation values are interdependent, making it difficult to achieve consistent results when manipulating rotations. The prPairBlend plugin provides a solution by offering a node that takes rotation values and rotation order as inputs and outputs Euler angle rotations with a locked twist and blends attribute-controlled angled weight. This simplifies the process of managing rotations and allows for precise control.
